	<div id="rrr"><p>A house (or home) is a player-built building necessary to spawn town NPCS, each of which needs a house. Buildings need to meet certain requirements in order to be used as houses (see section below). You can use a question mark ("? ") at the top of the House menu. ) button to check whether the building meets the requirements. At night, NPCS typically return to their houses and stay there until dawn. They also return to the house during eclipses or rains. The wizard appears when the new world opens, but if he is killed he needs a house to regenerate. Old people, travelers, and skeleton merchants don't ask for houses. Similarly, the initial appearance of guides, fishermen, Goblin craftsmen, saloons, mechanics, hairdressers, wizards, tax collectors, and golfers has nothing to do with the availability of housing. Once they are first discovered, everyone needs to have a proper house before they can be reborn. Some naturally generated buildings can act as houses as long as the player places a light source in them and will inadvertently attract NPCS. Such as the buildings on the floating island, and the treasure room of the Tree of Life. See the section below for a detailed list. The House menu can be used to move NPCS living in it to the player's building. The requirement for the player to select a bed as a spawn point is similar to the requirement for an NPC house, but slightly more relaxed. Players do not need furniture other than a bed. See the bed page for full details. A menu for managing NPC placement, accessed by clicking on the small house icon above the armor bar. In the house menu

	<div id="rrr1">Bosses are aggressive and tough enemies that present significant challenges to the player. Defeating the Boss often helps advance the game in some way, such as providing the player with new material needed for a higher level pick. Each Boss has its own specific way to summon. For example, the vast majority of bosses have corresponding summoning items that can be used to manually trigger the Boss generation under certain conditions, while others appear after the player has interacted with the environment in a certain way. Event bosses only appear during their corresponding event and leave at the end of the event. There are also small bosses, which only appear during special events and show the same difficulty as many normal bosses</div>
	<div id="rrr2">Weapons are essential items for fighting enemies, bosses, animals, and even other players (during PvP games). Some weapons can be crafted on the workbench or at the anvil before Hard Mode, while others can only be found in treasure chests, dropped by enemies, or purchased from NPCS. Terraria has a wide variety of weapons and weapon classes, each suitable for a specific play style or a specific mission. Most tools can also be used as weapons, although this is not their primary purpose. In a broader sense, organs, NPCS that are defending themselves, and even lava can be used as weapons</div>
